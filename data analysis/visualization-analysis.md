**RQ C.b: "How do road pavement types and geospatial locations (inside or outside built-up areas), influence the number of cycling incidents in Amsterdam?**

![alt text](Cycling_Incidents_by_Netherlands_province.png)
This study focuses on Amsterdam because the scope of the broader research is Amsterdam. In addition preliminary analysis of this dataset revealed it has the highest incidence of cycling accidents among Dutch districts, with over 30,000 recorded incidents, significantly surpassing other regions. This prevalence makes it a critical case study for urban cycling infrastructure challenges.


**H C.b.1: A significantly higher number of cycling incidents occur inside built-up areas(BI) than outside (BU).**

![Alt text](Most_common_Built-up_Area_type_in_Amsterdam.png)
The pie chart reveals that 98.8% of cycling incidents occur inside built-up areas (urban zones), while only 1.2% occur outside (rural/highway landscapes). This strongly supports Hypothesis H C.b.1, underscoring the need to prioritise safety interventions in Amsterdam’s urban cycling infrastructure. However, this disparity may partly reflect Amsterdam's high urban cycling density. Additionally, underreporting of rural incidents could contribute to the observed imbalance.


**H C.b.2: Paved surfaces account for a significantly higher number of cycling incidents than unpaved surfaces**

The horizontal bar illustrates the distribution of cycling incidents across pavement types in Amsterdam. Sidewalk Tiles & Pavement account for the highest number of incidents (approximately 60), while Unpaved Sand & Wood have the lowest (approximately 2). This strongly supports Hypothesis H C.b.2, demonstrating that conventional paved surfaces (Sidewalk Tiles & Pavement, Cobblestone & Asphalt Mix) are associated with significantly higher incident frequencies compared to unpaved surfaces (Unpaved, Sand & Wood; Loose Surfaces & Gravel). Train/Tram Tracks is excluded from this comparison due to the low incident count, which may reflect underreported or localised risks in Amsterdam. Our digital intervention addresses this gap by enabling crowdsourced hazard reporting through its mobile widget and web platform, allowing cyclists to identify and log track-specific dangers like rail grooves or poor visibility—data often missing from official records. The tool’s geospatial clustering and weighted algorithms then prioritise these reports alongside municipal data. Moreover, the integrated Fietsbuddy AI uses this information to provide safer, real-time route recommendations that avoid high-risk zones. Together, these features transform underreported risks into actionable insights for infrastructure improvements.


**H C.b.3: The proportion of cycling incidents on hazardous pavement types has decreased over time (2004–2012), while incidents on safer surfaces have remained stable.**

The combined stacked bar and line graph illustrates how different pavement types influenced the number of cycling incidents in Amsterdam between 2004 and 2012. The results strongly support Hypothesis H C.b.3. Train/Tram Tracks exhibit a sharp decline by 80% in cycling incidents from 2008–2010, while Loose Surfaces & Gravel show a more stable and gradual reduction. This trend aligns with Amsterdam's targeted infrastructure improvements for high-risk pavements. These results validate our Machine Learning tool’s ability to prioritize high-risk lanes through hazard scoring, a strategy that can significantly improve Amsterdam’s cycling infrastructure by aligning repairs with observed improvement trends. --> hazardess identified by hyp 2 and is true bc its biggest decline
